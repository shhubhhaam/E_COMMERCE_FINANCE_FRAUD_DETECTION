## 📊 Discrete Mathematics Concepts

### 1️⃣ Set Theory

Define fundamental sets over the transaction universe:

```
F  = {x ∈ U | x is fraudulent}
NF = {x ∈ U | x is non-fraudulent} = U \ F
H  = {x ∈ U | amount(x) > $500}
N  = {x ∈ U | hour(x) ∈ [22, 6]}
Y  = {x ∈ U | customer_age(x) < 25}
NA = {x ∈ U | account_age(x) < 30 days}
```

**Set Operations:**
- `F ∩ H`: Fraudulent AND high-value transactions
- `F ∩ N`: Fraudulent AND night transactions
- `F ∩ Y ∩ NA`: Fraudulent AND young AND new accounts
- Risk Score = |F ∩ S| / |S| × 100%

### 2️⃣ Propositional Logic

Define atomic propositions:
```
p: Transaction amount > $500
q: Transaction hour ∈ [22, 6]
r: Account age < 30 days
s: Customer age < 25 years
t: Shipping address ≠ Billing address
```

**Compound Rules:**
- `R₁ = p ∧ q` (Night High-Value)
- `R₂ = r ∧ p` (New Account High-Value)
- `R₃ = (p ∧ t) ∨ (q ∧ t)` (Address Mismatch Pattern)
- `R₄ = r ∧ q ∧ p` (Triple Threat)
- `R₅ = (r ∧ s) ∧ (p ∨ u)` (Young New Account Pattern)

### 3️⃣ Relations

Binary relations for connection analysis:
```
R_CI = {(c, ip) | customer c used IP address ip}
R_CD = {(c, d) | customer c used device d}
```

- Detect shared IPs (many customers → one IP)
- Identify multiple devices per customer
- Find equivalence classes by transaction signature

### 4️⃣ Graph Theory

Bipartite graph construction:
```
G = (V₁ ∪ V₂, E)
V₁ = {Customer nodes}
V₂ = {IP Address nodes}
E = {(customer, IP) | transaction occurred}
```

**Graph Metrics:**
- Node degree (connections per entity)
- Connected components (fraud rings)
- Centrality measures (hub detection)
- Component density (coordination level)

### 5️⃣ Combinatorics

Feature combination analysis:
```
C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2 pairwise combinations
P(Fraud | Feature₁ ∩ Feature₂)
```

Identify high-risk combinations with statistical significance.
